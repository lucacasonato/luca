TLDR: I work at [Antipy](https://antipy.com) 👨‍💼, and go to school 🏫. I use Linux 🐧 on my PC 🖥️. I love rockets 🚀 and 🌌.

I started out my _career_ as a developer when I was 9. A friend from school showed me what **Batch** was. I started making some simple games like rock, paper, scissors and tools like a calculator.

At around age 13 I started trying to do web development. I made my first site with a friend. It was a horrible site.

Around that time I also started working with microcontrollers like Arduino, and tiny computers like the Raspberry PI. I started a computer club at school where me and a few friends would teach students how to make basic websites and how to run basic commands on Arduino.

After some more software projects one of my current business partners [Jaap Aarts](http://github.com/jaicewizard) and me built a scheduling system for our school because we were fed up with the one they were using. It had a horrible user experience.

At some point [Jaap](http://github.com/jaicewizard), [Daniël](https://linkedin.com/in/dani%C3%ABl-lizarazo-fuentes-249252173) and me started a company called [Antipy](https://antipy.com). We develop custom software for microcontrollers, mobile, desktop and web. We use JavaScript, React, Go and Rust or anything else that is hot right now.

Some of my personal intrests include: space, astronomy, computer hardware, the climate and politics.
